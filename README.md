# ðŸš— Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements an intelligent, real-time pricing engine for 14 urban parking lots based on occupancy, queue length, traffic conditions, special days, and more. The goal is to optimize lot utilization using dynamic pricing strategies.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Numpy)
- Pathway (Real-time streaming)
- Bokeh (Visualization)
- Google Colab (Notebook environment)
- GitHub (Version control & hosting)

    B --> C1[Model 1: Baseline Linear Pricing]
    B --> C2[Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing]
    B --> C3[Model 3: Competitive Pricing (Optional)]
    C1 --> D[Real-Time Price Output via Pathway]
    C2 --> D

    D --> E[Bokeh Visual Dashboard]
```
## ðŸ§  Project Workflow
- Data Collection: Dataset includes timestamped parking metrics (occupancy, queue, etc.)

- Feature Engineering: Occupancy rate, congestion level encoding, datetime merging

- Pricing Models:

- Model 1: Linear occupancy-based

- Model 2: Demand function with multiple features

- Model 3 (optional): Competitive pricing based on geospatial proximity

- Real-Time Simulation: Implemented using Pathway stream processor

- Visualization: Bokeh plots for price over time and lot comparisons
